# Consumer Trend Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical price trends and variability across various commodity categories, such as metals, plant extracts, grains, and fuel. The aim is to identify correlations, trends, and variability in commodity prices over time and across categories, providing insights into market dynamics and key drivers of price changes.

## Guiding Questions
1. **Is there a significant difference in the price of meat compared to the cost of fuel?**
   - Analyzed using statistical visualizations like KDE plots, line plots, and box plots.
   - Results highlight significant differences in volatility and pricing dynamics between meat and fuel.

2. **Are there observable relationships between the price of grain and the price of metal?**
   - Investigated using scatter plots and line plots.
   - Results show weak correlations between the two categories, with independent market drivers for grains and metals.

3. **What attributes in the dataset are positively or negatively correlated?**
   - Explored using a correlation matrix and heatmap.
   - Key findings include strong positive correlations within categories (e.g., metals, grains) and weak or negative correlations across categories.

4. **Have the prices of plant-based products evolved over time?**
   - Analyzed using an area plot.

5. **What is the variability between the price of plant extract and the price of metal?**
   - Examined using scatter plots and KDE plots.

## Key Findings
- **Commodity Variability**:
  - Fuel prices exhibit higher volatility than meat prices.
  - Plant extracts have greater price variability compared to metals.
- **Correlations**:
  - Strong positive correlations exist within categories like metals, grains, and plant extracts.
  - Cross-category correlations are weak or negative, reflecting independent market dynamics.
- **Historical Trends**:
  - Prices for most commodities have evolved over time, influenced by global events, technological advancements, and economic policies.
